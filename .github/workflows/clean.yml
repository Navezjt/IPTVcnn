            This pull request is created automatically by `clean` action. 

            The script checks each link and removes only those that return a HTTP 404 code (Not Found). Also, the script ignores links with labels `[Geo-blocked]` and `[Not 24/7]` in the title.

            **IMPORTANT:** Before merging all links should be checked manually to make sure that the response from the server has not changed. Working links should be marked as `[Not 24/7]` so that next time the script will not delete them.
